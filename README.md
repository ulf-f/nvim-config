# nvim-config
save my personal nvim (neovim) config here

The init.lua is a raw copy (24.03.2024) of the neovim kickstart
project [1] including my adjustments.

The init.lua file need's to be placed into
~/.config/nvim/ dir. created it if its not there.

The easiest way to copy the content of the init.lua
I think is (cd into the directory where you want to have it):
curl -JLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulf-f/nvim-config/main/init.lua
