# nvim-config
save my personal nvim (neovim) config here

The init.lua is a raw copy (24.03.2024) of the neovim kickstart
project [1] including my adjustments.

The init.lua file need's to be placed into
~/.config/nvim/ dir. created it if its not there.

Nice short guide how to setup nvim with kickstart
